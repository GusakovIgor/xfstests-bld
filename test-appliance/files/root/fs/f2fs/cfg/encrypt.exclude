// exclude file for f2fs/encrypt

// When encryption is enabled this uses space in the extended attribute
// area which impacts the number of ACL entries that can be created
// which this test does not take into account.

// These tests use the old-style quota support where the quota files are user
// files instead of hidden inodes.  This isn't compatible with
// test_dummy_encryption, as it causes the quota files to be encrypted.

// these tests fail because encryption requires more space in the
// directory for each directory entry, and so the setup runs into
// an EDQUOT error early, which then causes the test failure.  This is
// a test bug; the quota limit needs to be set based on exactly how much
// directory space is consumed during the setup phase
