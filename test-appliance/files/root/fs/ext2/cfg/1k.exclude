// exclude file for ext2/1k copied from ext4/1k

// The test fails due to too many block group descriptors when the

// This test tries to create 65536 directories, and with 1k blocks,
// and long names, we run out of htree depth
ext4/045

// This test creates too many inodes on when the block size is 1k
// without using special mkfs.ext4 options to change the inode size.
// This test is a bit bogus anyway, and uses a bunch of magic calculations
// where it's not clear what it was originally trying to test in the
// first place.  So let's just skip it for now.

// This test creates too many extended attributes to fit in a 1k block
