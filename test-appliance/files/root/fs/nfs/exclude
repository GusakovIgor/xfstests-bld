#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(5,4,0)
// There appears to be a regression that shows up sometime after 5.4.
// LTS kernels for 4.14, 4.19, and 5.4 will terminate successfully,
// but newer kernels will spin forever in some kind of deadlock or livelock
// This apparently does not happen if the scratch device is > 27GB, so it
// may be some kind of ENOSPC-related bug.
