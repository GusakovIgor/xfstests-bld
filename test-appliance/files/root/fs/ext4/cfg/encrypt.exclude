ext4/004	// dump/restore doesn't handle quotas

// These tests try to create extended attributes which are
// large enough to stress the limits of the available
// xattr size.  This causes problems with encryption
// which requires its own xattrs which take space.

// This test to make sure ext4 directory entries are appropriately
// wiped after a file is deleted, or after htree operations is
// incompatible with an encrypted directory.
ext4/048

// These tests use the old-style quota support where the quota files are user
// files instead of hidden inodes.  This isn't compatible with
// test_dummy_encryption, as it causes the quota files to be encrypted.

// generic/204 tests ENOSPC handling; it doesn't correctly
// anticipate the external extended attribute required when
// using a 1k block size
generic/204

// these tests fail because encryption requires more space in the
// directory for each directory entry, and so the setup runs into
// an EDQUOT error early, which then causes the test failure.  This is
// a test bug; the quota limit needs to be set based on exactly how much
// directory space is consumed during the setup phase
