// generic/459 expects that a file system that it has been unable to freeze
// will be automatically remounted read only.  However, the default error
// handling policy for ext4 is to continue when possible after errors.
//
// A workaround was added to the test in the past to force ext4 to
// perform a read only remount in order to meet the test's expectations.
// The touch command was used to create a new file after a freeze failure.
// This forces ext4 to start a new journal transaction, where it discovers
// the journal has previously aborted due to lack of space, and triggers
// special case error handling that results in a read only remount.  But
// this only works if there is a journal.

// This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
// configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.
