// exclude file for ext4/adv

ext4/004	// dump/restore doesn't handle inline data

// ext4/044 tries to mount the file system as ext3 explicitly.  This will
// fail because ext3 and the inline_data feature are incompatible.
ext4/044

// This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
// configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.

// This test is failing flakily with a data file mismatch after a simulated
// power failure.  This needs to be investigated.
generic/455	// EXPFAIL

// This test simulates open by file handle; the problem is that file handles
// for inline directories doesn't work.  This is definitely an ext4 bug with
// the inline_data feature.  We need to fix this...
generic/477	// EXPFAIL

// This test is confirming whether the project id change works after a
// power failure.  Apparently there is a quota inconsistency in this case,
// which is a file system bug.
generic/506	// EXPFAIL

// This test uses the shutdown ioctl and it is apparently triggering a reliable
// failure with the adv test case.
generic/737	// EXPFAIL
