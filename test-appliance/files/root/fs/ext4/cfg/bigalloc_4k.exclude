// exclude file for ext4/bigalloc_4k

ext4/004	// dump/restore doesn't handle the bigalloc feature

// ext4/033 creates a special file system using dmhugedisk to test for
// inode overflow when online resizing.  With a bigalloc config, this takes
// too much space, so test VM will hang or abort the test run.  We
// don't need to test this for all file system configs, so just skip it here.
ext4/033

// ext4/044 tries to mkfs the test file system as ext3 explicitly.  This
// initially fails because ext3 and the inline_data feature are incompatible.
// However, _scratch_do_mkfs() retries by stripping off the bigalloc and
// inline_data options, resulting in a successful but irrelevant test.
ext4/044

// This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
// configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.
generic/027

// This test needs to know the inode size and block size for the file
// system; for bigalloc, we need to use the cluster size instead of the
// block size.
generic/204

// This test is a quota accounting test.  For bigalloc, the cluster
// size of 64k is way too big to deal with the artificial fudge used
// in the test to deal with wrong block sizes.  The test really needs
// to be rewritten to understand block/allocation sizes....
generic/219

// This test uses the block size to figure out how many files to
// create; for bigalloc, we need to use the cluster size instead of the
// block size.
generic/273

// This test creates a very small file system on a dm-thin device.
// The file system is too small for bigalloc, so skip it.  It was
// introduced to test a dm-thin bug combined with an XFS bug regression.
// If it's a problem for ext4, we'll catch it in other ext4 configs.
generic/500

// These tests assume that the directory will get expanded when
// additional entries are added.  With bigalloc and with htree
// directories, this is not the case.  Since no blocks are added,
// there is no attempted block allocation and so the expected
// EDQUOT failure didn't happen.
