// exclude file for ext4/1k

// The test fails due to too many block group descriptors when the
// block size is 1k
ext4/033

// This test tries to create 65536 directories, and with 1k blocks,
// and long names, we run out of htree depth
ext4/045

// This test creates too many inodes on when the block size is 1k
// without using special mkfs.ext4 options to change the inode size.
// This test is a bit bogus anyway, and uses a bunch of magic calculations
// where it's not clear what it was originally trying to test in the
// first place.  So let's just skip it for now.
generic/273

// This test creates too many extended attributes to fit in a 1k block
generic/454

// These tests result in an fsck.ext4 inconsistency: "Inode NNNN, end
// of extent exceeds allowed value" apparently only with a 1k
// blocksize.  Unclear whether this is an e2fsck or ext4 bug, but it
// apparently doesn't happen in real life.  It is apparently triggered
// by shutdowns and/or a highly parallel modification of the extent tree.
