// In data=journal mode, fsync() will try to write data blocks into
// the journal.  This will cause the file system to go read-only
// when the journal aborts as a result of the device being put
// into dm-error mode, and this guarantees that this test will fail.

// Ext4 doesn't suppport mounting with norecovery && data=journal.
// We could fix this in the future by no giving an error in the case
// where we are mounting with ro, norecovery, and data=journal.
// (XFS requires ro with norecovery, and perhaps we should make
// a similar restriction.)
generic/537

// This test uses dioread_nolock which currently isn't supported with
// data=journal

// This test fails with a data file mismatch after a simulated power failure
// This is apparently specific to data=journal mode, which is weird.
generic/455	// EXPFAIL

// In data=journal mode, a fdatasync will result in a journal failure if
// the block device is flipped to non-working mode, so the error returned
// witll be EROFS instead of EIO
